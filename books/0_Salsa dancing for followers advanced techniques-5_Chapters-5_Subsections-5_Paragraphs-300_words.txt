4. Dile Que No-----


4. Dile Que No

As a follower, one of the most important things you can do is learn how to say "no" when your leader tries to lead you into a move you're not comfortable with. It's your dance and your body, and you have a right to set your own boundaries.

There are a few different ways to say "no" in salsa. One is to simply stop dancing and stand still. This is the most direct way to communicate that you don't want to do a certain move, but it can also be interpreted as a challenge by your partner. If they're a experienced dancer, they may try to coax you into doing the move anyway.

Another way to say "no" is to keep dancing, but to do your own thing instead of following your partner's lead. This is less direct than stopping altogether, but it still gets the message across that you're not interested in doing the move they're trying to lead you into.

A third way to say "no" is to lead yourself into a different move. This is the most passive way to say "no," but it can be effective if your partner is insistent on leading you into a move you don't want to do.

 Whichever way you choose to say "no," the important thing is to be assertive and clear in your communication. Your partner should always respect your wishes, and if they don't, you always have the option to stop dancing altogether.

5. Salsa Shimmy-----


5. Salsa Shimmy

The salsa shimmy is a fun and easy move that can be used to add variety to your dancing. It is also a great way to add some spice to your dancing if you feel like you are getting bored with the basic steps.

The salsa shimmy is a move where you shake your hips from side to side. This move can be done with both feet on the ground or by lifting one foot off the ground and shaking your hips.

To do the salsa shimmy, start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart. Then, shift your weight onto your left foot and lift your right foot off the ground.

Once you are standing on your left foot, start to shake your hips from side to side. You can use your arms to help keep your balance.

To make the salsa shimmy more challenging, you can try lifting your left foot off the ground and shaking your hips. This move is called the double shimmy.

Once you have mastered the basic salsa shimmy, you can try adding some variations. For example, you can try shaking your hips in a circular motion or you can try shaking your hips from side to side and then front to back.

The possibilities are endless! Just have fun and be creative.
